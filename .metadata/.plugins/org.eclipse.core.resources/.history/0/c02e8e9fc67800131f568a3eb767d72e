	/**
	 * BONUS: Extra credit problem
	 * 
	 * Feel free to skip this one if you don't have time.
	 * It's a little harder.
	 * 
	 * You are given a map indicating the elevation of
	 * a small area like a desk.  A ball is placed on the desk.
	 * The ball will roll downhill going north south east or west.
	 *
	 * The ball always starts at position 1,1
	 *
	 * It will always choose the path of steepest descent.
	 * It will eventually come to rest when it is at a position
	 * where all neighboring positions are higher/equal.  
	 * Return the elevation of that position.
	 * 
	 * You can assume that map will be such that the ball
	 * will always come to rest without moving through an edge
	 * 
	 * You can assume there will always be one steepest
	 * position for the ball to go to
	 * 
	 * For example, in an array like this:
	 * 9999
	 * 9549
	 * 9999 yields 4
	 * The ball would start in 1,1 (5) rolls to 4 and stops
	 * 
	 * 99999999999
	 * 98711111199
	 * 96999999999
	 * 95444444399
	 * 99999999999 yields 4
	 * The ball starts at 8, follows steepest decent to 6
	 * Then at the first 4 there is no lower position so it
	 * stops

	 * @param map map indicating elevation
	 * @return height where the ball stops
